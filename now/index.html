    <div class="mainbox"><h1>What I've Been Up To</h1>
<p>This is my now page. As the name says, it's about what I've been focusing on as of late. Will (hopefully) be regularly updated!</p>
<h2>Website</h2>
<p>I've been adding small bits of Javascript to the site to improve UX/UI with things like themes and sounds. A blog may be coming soon!</p>
<h2>Art</h2>
<p>Currently studying the anatomy of the human body for better character illustrations.</p>
<h2>Gaming</h2>
<p>Trying to beat ULTRAKILL. It's pretty hard, but that's how you learn.</p>
<h2>Academics</h2>
<p>Studying Spanish. Many people at my school speak it and it's one of the most spoken languages in the world.</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>Eating better and getting some more fresh air to make my body the way I'd rather it be.</h2>
